# Text Splitter Utility

## Overview

This project provides a set of text splitting utilities designed to handle various text formats efficiently. The primary classes included are:

- **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: A utility for splitting text based on character limits, recursively managing nested structures.
- **CharacterTextSplitter**: A straightforward text splitter that divides text into chunks based on specified character limits.
- **RecursiveJsonSplitter**: A specialized splitter for JSON data, allowing for the recursive extraction of content while maintaining the structure.


### Examples

#### 1. Using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

This class is useful when you need to split a long string of text into smaller segments while considering nested structures.

#### 2. Using CharacterTextSplitter

For simpler use cases where you just want to split text based on character count without recursion.

#### 3. Using RecursiveJsonSplitter

When dealing with JSON data, this splitter helps maintain the structure while extracting content.
